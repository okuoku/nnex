(nnex synrules runtime) ;; opaque from users

(nnex synrules) library:
    _ ;; AUX
    ... ;; AUX
    syntax-rules

(nnex core) library:
    define-syntax
    core-form ;; (core-form KEYWORD form ...)
    core-define ;; (core-define SYM form)
    core-quote

    core-body ;; lambda body
    core-invalid-form ;; (core-invalid-form debug ...)
    

We don't have "core-extend-syntax" because we translate letrec-syntax into
define-syntax.

"core-extend" is just a speed hack. Although i generally don't want to include
any speed hack into core language, but we need it to support "let" syntax 
natively with "core-form"..
